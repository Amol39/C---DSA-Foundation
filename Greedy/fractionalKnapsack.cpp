/*
Given the weights and profits of N items, in the form of {profit,weight} put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total profit in the knapsack. In fractional knapsack, we can break items for maximizing the total value of the knapsack.

input  arr[]= {{60,10},{100,20},{120,30}}, W = 50
output : 240

Explanation : By taking items of weight 10 and 20 kg and 2/3 of 30 kg.
Hence total price will be 60+100+(2/3)(120) = 240
